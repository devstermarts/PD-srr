# PD-ssr
 PD implementation of 'Sinusoidal Run Rhythm' by Steffen Krebber

 ## Sinusoidal Run Rhythm
 /"'sinusoidal run rhythm' proposes a definition of rhythm as a wave. It does not conceive of time as discrete subdivisions, but makes it continuously quantifiable. Concurrently, through the aesthetics of wave additions, it does not present physicality as a merely subjective concept and thus liberates it from mystification."/

 ## Implementation for Pure Data
 PD-SSR is a PD implementation of Krebber's concept of 'Sinusoidal Run Rhythm' as described in his research project and book of the [same name](https://steffenkrebber.de/research/sinusoidal-run-rhythm/).

 ## Examples/ Showcase
 <WIP>

 ## Observations, open issues and questions:
 Todo: check lists of coprime tuples and triples for validity

 ## Other
 A modular component version of this implementation can be found in the [PD-components](https://github.com/devstermarts/PD-components/blob/main/various/ssrmod.pd) repository.
