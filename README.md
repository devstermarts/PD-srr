# PD-srr
 PD implementation of 'Sinusoidal Run Rhythm' by Steffen Krebber

 ## Sinusoidal Run Rhythm
 > "'sinusoidal run rhythm' proposes a definition of rhythm as a wave. It does not conceive of time as discrete subdivisions, but makes it continuously quantifiable. Concurrently, through the aesthetics of wave additions, it does not present physicality as a merely subjective concept and thus liberates it from mystification."
